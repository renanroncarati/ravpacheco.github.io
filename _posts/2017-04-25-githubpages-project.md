> Starting with opensource projects, trying to make a better world with code

This project is inspired on opensource projecs and also a way to create a history of myself, my work, hobbies and log my life coding!

Since last year, I've been looking for an opensource project, to work with. I was not looking for big projects, but usefull ones, or easy to start
contribuiting. "Oh, so you're seeking for a piece of cake!?" The answer is no, definitely not. I have no expirience with opensource projets yet, so to
give my coding life a start, it has to be an easy step, becouse if I get stuck with big or hard problems at the beggining, may be I should not finish or
may be I'll fail (fail in this case means, I will procrastinate until I leave the project).

So, I decided to start with a project about myself for myself and for the opensource community, creating my first blog - project - resum√® page, using of course, github pages!

The idea here is to make log about my developer life, logging things I've learned, forcing me to study more before I post something stupid, learn with the community
and also share with the community what I'm learning.

To start "The Great Developer Journey" I think I need to contribute more, to study more and to register all my progress!

If your are interested in learning how to create your own blog - page, here is where I've started!

1.  Starting with github pages course on udemy.com [Building Web Pages With GitHub Pages](https://www.udemy.com/github-pages "Building Web Pages With GitHub Pages")
2.  Read the [Rafael Pacheco](http://ravpacheco.com) page, navigate through blog posts and start coding with [Jekyll Windows Configuration](http://ravpacheco.com/instalando-jekyll-no-windows/)
3.	Now it is important to read the father of [Indigo Theme](https://github.com/sergiokopplin/indigo) Mr Kopplin.
4.  Prepare your localhost environment and start coding (or writing =D)
